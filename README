= sysexits

Have you ever wanted to call exit() with an error condition, but weren't sure what number to use?
No? Maybe it's just me, then.

Anyway, I was reading W. Richard Stephens's book _Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment_, and
I wanted to make my program exit with a reasonable exit code just like his C examples, but much to
my chagrin, I couldn't find a 'sysexits' for Ruby! Well, for the other 2 people that actually care
about this kind of thing, now there is!

You can check out the current development source with Mercurial like so:

    hg clone http://repo.deveiate.org/sysexits
