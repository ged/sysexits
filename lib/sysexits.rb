# Sysexits is a completely awesome collection of human-readable
# constants for the standard (BSDish) exit codes, used as arguments
# to Kernel.exit() to indicate a specific error condition to the
# parent process.
# 
# It's so fantastically fabuluous that you'll want to fork it right
# away to avoid being thought of as that guy that's still using Webrick
# for his blog. I mean, exit(1) is so passÃ©! This is like the 14-point
# font of Systems Programming.
# 
# Like the C header file from which this was derived (I mean forked,
# naturally), error numbers begin at Sysexits::EX__BASE (which is way
# more cool than plain old '64') to reduce the possibility of clashing
# with other exit statuses that other programs may already return.
# 
# The codes are available in two forms, as constants which can be
# imported into your own namespace via Kernel.include, or as a Hash
# keyed by a symbol derived from the constant name.
# 
# Allow me to demonstrate:
# 
#   exit( 69 ) 
# 
# Whaaa...? Is that a euphimism?
# 
#   include Sysexits
#   exit EX_UNAVAILABLE
# 
# Okay, at least this is readable to people who have used fork() more
# than twice, but you could do so much better!
# 
#   include Sysexits
#   exit :unavailable
#
# Holy Toledo! It's like we're writing Ruby, but our own made-up
# dialect in which variable++ is possible! Well, okay, it's not quite
# that cool. But it does look more Rubyish. And no monkeys were patched
# in the filming of this episode! All the simpletons still exiting
# with icky *numbers* can still continue blithely along, none the
# wiser.
